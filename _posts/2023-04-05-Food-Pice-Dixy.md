More than a year ago, I developed a keen interest in the fluctuations of food prices. To prepare myself and select the products that offered the most calories for the least money, I resolved to gather some statistics. During this year, many unforeseen events occurred, which economists call black swans. My price monitoring seemed to be a kind of gauge that could reveal the state of the economy. I have not yet made any remarkable discoveries from this data, but I continue to collect it.
