Voice control in computers was the theme that fascinated and tormented me. I had an article from an IT-site tucked away in my bookmarks, but I never opened it, fearing it might shatter my dreams. For a whole weekend, I immersed myself in the task of instructing my laptop to talk and listen, forgetting to feed my famished body. But it was a hard and hopeless endeavor. Siri, Alexa and their kin were magnificent and mighty helpers, out of my league. I managed to write a program that could query ChatGPT and receive answers, and in the process I learned many curious facts, such as the number of cities on Earth, the weight of the Moon, the winter habits of crayfish and the name of the last Roman emperor. All it took was a click of the mouse and a stream of knowledge would flow to me.
