My gpt api credit had expired, and I resolved to endow the voice assistant with full autonomy. I employed llama cpp and a prodigious language model of thirty billion parameters. The speed of operation did not suffer, or perhaps even improved a trifle, but the quality of responses in Russian or English declined somewhat. Yet for the sake of elucidating notions and terms, this sufficed, and I kept using the assistant by pressing the ninth button of my mouse and receiving answers to my queries. I had also appended a database for the answers. And I persisted in developing the project. Now I was busy with a lovely gui.
