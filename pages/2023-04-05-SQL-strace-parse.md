In the days of my web-hosting servitude, I often indulged in the curious habit of scanning the plaintive tickets of our clients, hoping to find some echo of a previous trouble that might illuminate the present one. For this purpose, I devised a nifty little program that performed this task for me, with a flicker of the console and a flourish of the keyboard.
