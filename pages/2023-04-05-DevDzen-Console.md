The first spark of my passion for programming was kindled by the [DevZen podcast](https://devzen.ru/), a delightful symphony of voices that discussed the mysteries and marvels of computer science. They were seasoned developers, versed in the arcane lore of algorithms and data structures, and I was a humble listener, eager to catch a glimpse of their wisdom. I could not comprehend everything they said, but I would jot down the terms that intrigued me and later explore them on my own. The podcast became my compass, guiding me to the topics that I would share with my colleagues at my former job. I conceived the idea of creating a podcast player for the Linux CLI, a modest tribute to the source of my inspiration. In the early days of the podcast, they had a forum where I timidly posted my proposal. They were so gracious and generous that they offered me their feedback and suggested me to use the curses library. I completed the program but never used it, yet I was content nonetheless.

PS: I  asked GPT-4 rewrite my text in Nabokov style :) The first spark of my passion for programming was kindled much earlier, but otherwise everything is fine.
