I have always found that studying without applying oneâ€™s knowledge to practical problems is a near-futile exercise. In my quest to learn English more effectively and enjoyably, I devised several methods, among which was a project to translate the MySQL 8.0 Documentation into Russian. I relished working in a team and enthused my colleague with my passion. We engaged in asynchronous brainstorming of the finest kind. But when the weblate server was finally ready for our work, our lives took a different turn. We only managed to translate one page before abandoning the project. Now my English has improved considerably, and I have switched to another database. Thus, the project remains in its embryonic stage, waiting for someone else to pick it up and nurture it.
