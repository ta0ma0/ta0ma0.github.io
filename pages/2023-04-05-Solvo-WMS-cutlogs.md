I had not yet spent six months in the service of WMS when I began to feel a vague dissatisfaction with the manual drudgery that filled our days. To slice and dice the logs for bug reports was a tedious task that made my fingers twitch with the urge to automate it. And so I set out to craft a script that would do the work for me, with a secret thrill of artistic pride. But alas, by the time I finished my masterpiece, the handiwork had become so swift and streamlined that automation was rendered superfluous. Still, on rare occasions, I find a use for my script, and it performs admirably.
