I have always enjoyed listening to music, and I listened more and more. But I never paid much heed to the audio equipment, as long as it played. But my tastes evolved over time, and I began to appreciate complex electronic and instrumental music, which cheap headphones could not render properly. The solution was to compare the prices and specifications of different headphones in an online store, using the dynamic range of playback as a criterion. I did so, and I found several attractive models in terms of price and quality. But later I discovered that the dynamic range in the sellersâ€™ specifications often did not correspond to reality.
