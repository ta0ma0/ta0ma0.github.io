To polish my craft of coding, I often indulge in fanciful reveries of what I might create. It is not a simple task, for the modern world abounds with solutions for every palate and problem. I have a friend, an electronic music artiste, with whom I converse about my musical preferences and tastes. I conceived a project to scan my collection and gather statistics by genres. The genres I borrowed from everynoise.com. Then I tallied the names of artistes and genres and constructed diagrams.
