Every programmer, at the dawn of his career, faces a certain meteorological puzzle. I myself was no exception. It was summer, and my parents had decided to dispose of an ancient LCD TV. A sudden inspiration seized me: why not transform it into an information monitor, a kind of starship dashboard or a data panel? My abode was near the sea, and not every service could supply the water temperature, but Yandex could. At first I tried to scrape the weather website, then I switched to using the API. The feature that distinguished my monitor was its display of a literary quote from one of the thousand books in my collection. The quote was selected according to the weather: if it rained, a passage where rain was mentioned would appear. This was an innovation, a curiosity, a delight. I loved my monitor.
