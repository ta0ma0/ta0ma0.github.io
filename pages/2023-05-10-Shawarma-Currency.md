In the wake of my move to Armenia, a recurrent conundrum befell me – the onus of transmuting Armenian drams to rubles and vice versa. But lo and behold, in a moment of felicity, I happened upon a web-based solution, capable of such conversions. Yet for the sake of whimsy, I included an ancillary function – to determine the amount of savory shawarma one could procure with said currencies. As it happened, this mirthful addition proved quite advantageous, and I swiftly incorporated the service into my daily routine. The project itself was wrought with Flask, and culled exchange rates from the official source.
