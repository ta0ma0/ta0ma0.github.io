Having acquired a Pythonic education through the virtual halls of an online university, I set out to find a suitable occupation. My first recourse was HeadHunter, a site where employers and employees could meet and negotiate. I wished to ascertain the state of the IT industry, the abundance of vacancies, and the range of remuneration. To this end, I devised a clever program that would extract and analyze the relevant data from the site. Thus armed with information, I ventured into the job market.
